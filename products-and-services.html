						<li>Founded in 1992, as Max Security & Residential Patrols.</li>
						<li>
							Due to increasing demand, the company evolved to offer permanent 
							and temporary on-site security officers.
						</li>
						<li>
							Continued expansion of both the response and guard’s divisions, 
							including close liaison and involvement with all local crime 
							prevention bodies, allowed the company to become the dominant 
							Security Service in the area.
						</li>
						<li>
							By early 1997 the company was very well established and had 
							already earned an extremely good reputation amongst the community 
							who knew they could rely on Max Security to provide an efficient 
							and reliable service.
						</li>
						<li>
							In 2002 a name change was applied for and 42<sup>nd</sup> Precinct Security 
							was born. All clients accepted and embraced the name change and 
							continued to be valuable customers of this company.
						</li>
						<li>
							The ownership of the company changed March 2004.The company is 
							wholly owned by Allan Millard (MBA), who is the incumbent Managing 
							Director, and has been at the helm ever since.
						</li>
						<li>
							In 2005, the Electronics Solutions Division was established, to 
							to satisfy the ever-growing need of Intrusion Detection Systems 
							in households and enterprise buildings.

					<br>
					We can transmit any, or all, alarm signals to relevant clients, via SMS or GPRS
					This affords our clients early notification on alarm signals transmitted by their own alarms.
					The Armed Response vehicle is notified to respond to the address by the Controller on duty in the control room. This after the necessary calls are made to ensure a real response situation.
					This would ensure that the vehicle Reaction Officer would know about the activation so that the officer responds in a coordinated manner and will arrive within three to seven minutes of being dispatched by the control room.
					<br>
					All vehicles are equipped with
					<ul>
						<li>Satellite tracking</li>
						<li>GPS - All clients are pre-loaded on the GPS to ensure a quick as possible response time.</li>
						<li>Base Radios</li>
						<li>Cell phones</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					There is a rendezvous service for armed response clients. This does not have a call out fee associated unless the client has a specific daily requirement, or whether it be adhoc or regular. This is a point that must be discussed to understand how to quote and cost for it
					<br>
					Armed Response vehicles are stationed in and around the Ferndale, Randburg area and are moved to various points at different times determined by the control room when there are no alarms to be attended to, where the vehicles are required to respond to.
